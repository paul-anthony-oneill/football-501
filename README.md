## 📋 Overview

**Football 501** is a daily puzzle and multiplayer game that combines football knowledge with the scoring system of darts 501. Players compete to reduce their score from 501 to exactly 0 by naming football players whose statistics (appearances, goals, etc.) match a given question.

### 🎯 Key Features

- ⚡ **Real-time multiplayer** matches with live WebSocket updates
- 📅 **Daily challenges** with global leaderboards
- 🤖 **AI opponents** for practice (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- 🏆 **Competitive ranking system** with 36 ranks (Sunday League to Icon)
- 👥 **Friend challenges** (real-time and asynchronous)
- 📱 **Progressive Web App** - works on desktop and mobile
- 🆓 **Freemium model** - Free daily challenge + 1 match/day

---

## 🎮 How to Play

### Basic Rules

1. **Start with 501 points**
2. A question is presented (e.g., "Appearances for Manchester City in Premier League")
3. **Take turns** naming different players
4. Each player's **statistic is deducted** from your score
5. First to reach **exactly 0** (or -10 to 0 range) wins!

### Scoring Example

**Question**: "Appearances for Arsenal in Premier League"

- You name **"Thierry Henry"** (258 appearances)
  - Score: 501 - 258 = **243**
- Opponent names **"Tony Adams"** (255 appearances)
  - Opponent score: 501 - 255 = **246**

Continue until someone reaches 0!

### Special Rules

- **Bust**: Answers over 180 or invalid darts scores (163, 166, 169, etc.) score **nothing**
- **Checkout Range**: Finish between **-10 and 0**
- **No Repeats**: Can't reuse answers in the same game
- **Turn Timer**: 45 seconds (default) per turn with escalating timeouts
- **Question Refresh**: One chance to request a new question (both players must agree)

## 🏆 Ranking System

Football 501 features a **football-themed ranking system** with 9 tiers and 4 subtiers each (36 total ranks):

### Tiers (Low → High)

1. ⚽ **Sunday League**
2. 🏅 **Amateur**
3. 🥉 **Semi-Pro**
4. 🎒 **Journeyman**
5. ⚡ **Pro**
6. 🌍 **International**

2. 🔄 **Rotation**
3. ⭐ **Starter**
4. 🔰 **Captain**

**Example**: "Pro Captain" → "International Reserve"

### How It Works

- **Hidden MMR** determines fair matchmaking
- **League Points** earned for wins (visible progression)
- Win against higher-rated opponent = more points
- Continuous progression (no seasonal resets)
- Ranked mode exclusive to **Premium** subscribers
