## Game Overview

Football 501 is a two-player competitive trivia game that combines football knowledge with darts 501 scoring mechanics.

### Objective

Be the first player to reduce your score from **501 to exactly 0** (or within the checkout range of **-10 to 0**) by correctly naming football players whose statistics match the given question.

### Core Concept

- Both players start with **501 points**
- A single **question** is presented for the entire game
- Players **alternate turns** naming different players that answer the question
- Each player's **statistic value** is deducted from your score
- The game continues until one player **checks out** (reaches -10 to 0 range)

---

## Scoring System

### Basic Scoring

1. **Starting Score**: Both players begin at **501 points**
2. **Deduction**: When a player names a valid answer, the player's statistic is deducted from their score
3. **Score Display**: Scores are updated in real-time after each turn

### Example

**Question**: "Appearances for Manchester City in Premier League"

- Player 1 names **"Kevin De Bruyne"** (200 appearances)
  - Score: 501 - 200 = **301**
- Player 2 names **"Sergio Agüero"** (275 appearances)
  - Score: 501 - 275 = **226**

---

## Valid Darts Scores

Not all numerical scores are valid in traditional 501 darts. Football 501 follows the same rules.

### Valid Scores (1-180)

A score is valid if it can be achieved with **3 darts** on a standard dartboard.

**Valid Examples**: 1-180 **EXCEPT** the invalid scores listed below

### Invalid Darts Scores

The following scores between 1-180 are **IMPOSSIBLE** in darts and therefore **invalid**:

```
163, 166, 169, 172, 173, 175, 176, 178, 179
```

### What Happens with Invalid Scores?

If a player's statistic equals an invalid darts score (e.g., 179 appearances):
- The answer is treated as a **bust**
- **No points are deducted**
- The turn is **wasted**
- Play passes to the opponent

**Example**:
- Question: "Appearances for Arsenal in Premier League"
- Answer: Player with **179 appearances**
- Result: **0 points scored** (bust)
- Player's score remains unchanged

---

## Game Flow

### 1. Game Start

1. Question is randomly selected (or predetermined for daily challenge)
2. Question is displayed to both players
3. Turn order is determined (Player 1 goes first)
4. Turn timer starts

### 2. Turn Sequence

```
Player 1's Turn → Player 2's Turn → Player 1's Turn → ...
```

Players alternate until one player checks out.

### 3. Submitting an Answer

On each turn, the active player must:

1. Type a player's name (e.g., "Sergio Aguero")
2. Submit before timer expires
3. Wait for validation

### 4. Answer Validation

The system validates the answer:

1. **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles spelling variations (e.g., "Aguero" = "Agüero")
2. **Question Match**: Ensures the player matches the question criteria
3. **Duplicate Check**: Ensures the answer hasn't been used already this game
4. **Score Validity**: Checks if the score is a valid darts score

### 5. Score Update

Based on validation:

- ✅ **Valid Answer**: Score is deducted, turn ends
- ❌ **Invalid Answer**: Player can retry immediately (timer keeps running)
- ❌ **Duplicate Answer**: Player can retry immediately
- ⚠️ **Bust** (invalid darts score or >180): No score deducted, turn wasted

### 6. Next Turn

After a valid submission or timeout:
- Play passes to the opponent
- Timer resets (unless consecutive timeouts occurred)
- Opponent's turn begins

### 7. Game End

Game ends when:
- A player **checks out** (reaches -10 to 0)
- A player **forfeits**
- Both players agree to **draw** (🔄 IN PROGRESS - not yet implemented)

---

## Turn Rules

### Turn Timer

- **Default**: 45 seconds per turn
- **Configurable**: Can be set at match start (30s, 45s, 60s, etc.)
- Timer starts when it becomes your turn
- Timer pauses if system is validating an answer

### Timeout Consequences

If a player's timer reaches **0:00** before submitting:

| Timeout # | Consequence | Next Turn Timer |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **1st** (non-consecutive) | Turn forfeited, no score change | 45s |
| **1st consecutive** | Turn forfeited, no score change | 45s |
| **2nd consecutive** | Turn forfeited, no score change | **30s** |
| **3rd consecutive** | Turn forfeited, no score change | **15s** |
| **4th consecutive** | **Match forfeited** (opponent wins) | N/A |

**Note**: A "consecutive timeout" means timing out on back-to-back turns. If you answer successfully, the timeout counter resets.

### Invalid Answer Handling

If a player submits an **invalid answer** (player doesn't exist, wrong team, misspelling not recognized):

- ❌ Instant rejection message shown
- ⏱️ Timer **continues running**
- 🔄 Player can immediately retry
- No penalty for invalid guesses (but wastes time)

## Winning Conditions

### Checkout Range

A player **checks out** when their score reaches the range **-10 to 0** (inclusive).

**Valid Checkout Scores**:
```
0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10
```

**Invalid Checkout Scores** (below -10):
```
-11, -12, -13, ... (game continues)
```

### Standard Win

**Player A wins** if:
- Player A reaches checkout range (-10 to 0)
- Player B has NOT yet checked out

**Example**:
- Player A: 12 points remaining
- Player A names a player with 15 appearances
- Player A's score: 12 - 15 = **-3** ✅ **Checked out!**
- Player B: 150 points remaining
- **Result**: Player A wins immediately

### Close Finish Rule

If **Player 1 checks out first**, **Player 2 gets ONE final turn** to attempt a closer checkout.

#### Scenario 1: Player 1 Checks Out, Player 2 Also Checks Out Closer

1. Player 1 checks out at **-9**
2. Player 2 gets one final turn
3. Player 2 names a player that brings score to **-5**
4. **Player 2 wins** (closer to 0)

#### Scenario 2: Player 1 Checks Out, Player 2 Checks Out Further

1. Player 1 checks out at **-3**
2. Player 2 gets one final turn
3. Player 2 names a player that brings score to **-8**
4. **Player 1 wins** (closer to 0)

#### Scenario 3: Player 1 Checks Out, Player 2 Fails to Check Out

1. Player 1 checks out at **-7**
2. Player 2 gets one final turn
3. Player 2 names a player but remains above 0 (e.g., 50 points left)
4. **Player 1 wins**

### Bust on Checkout Attempt

If a player would go **below -10**:

- Score **remains unchanged** (bust)
- Turn is wasted
- Opponent gets their turn
- Player can try again on next turn

**Example**:
- Player A: 5 points remaining
- Player A names a player with 20 appearances
- Calculation: 5 - 20 = **-15** (below -10)
- **Result**: Bust! Score stays at 5

## FAQ

### Can I use the same answer twice in one game?
❌ **No**. Once an answer is used in a game, it cannot be repeated.

### What if I misspell a name?
✅ The system uses **fuzzy matching**. "Aguero" will match "Agüero". However, if the system can't recognize the name, you'll get instant feedback to retry.

### What if two players match closely?
The system prefers the **valid answer** (even if it's a bust) when multiple matches exist.

### Can I go below -10?
❌ **No**. Scores below -10 result in a **bust** (turn wasted, score unchanged).

### What happens if both players time out repeatedly?
Each player's timeout consequences are **independent**. If both players hit 4 consecutive timeouts, both forfeit and the match is a draw (🔄 IN PROGRESS - edge case).

### Can I practice the rules?
✅ Yes! Use **AI Practice Mode** to learn the rules and test strategies.
